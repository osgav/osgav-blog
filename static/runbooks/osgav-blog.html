### Contributing applications and services

**Hugo** is the application that builds the website: a static website generator written in `go`. It takes a config file and a theme then mixes them with markdown-formatted content files to produce the HTML files that make up the website.

AWS **Route53, CloudFront, ACM** and **S3** are responsible for `osgav.run` DNS, CDN, HTTPS and hosting respectively. Together they provide fast HTTPS-based access to `osgav.run` from everywhere.

**GitHub** and **TravisCI** make up the deployment components of the system. GitHub version controls the blog source code and TravisCI builds and publishes a new copy of the website on pushes to the `master` branch of `osgav-blog`.

**paper.li** is a Content Aggregation feed integrated via an IFrame, so its content is retrieved by the browser. The paper.li feed updates periodically and can be added to manually.

## System characteristics

### Data and processing flows

upload: 

- **New content developed** locally with Hugo
- Changes pushed to GitHub `osgav-blog` repository
- TravisCI triggers on push to GitHub
- TravisCI builds Hugo site based on latest changes in `osgav-blog`
- TravisCI runs `post-build-script.sh`
- TravisCI publishes Hugo site to `osgav.run` S3 bucket
- Manual `Invalidate` request(s) may or may not be submitted in CloudFront
- **New content is LIVE**

download:

- Web browser makes request to `https://osgav.run`
- Route53 points them to CloudFront distribution
- CloudFront distribution serves content of `osgav.run` S3 bucket
- **Content is consumed...**

paper.li:

- paper.li Genius sources are refreshed once a week creating a new issue on Fridays
- additional articles can be manually published via paper.li console on-demand


### Infrastructure and network design

- 1x GitHub repository
- 1x TravisCI integration
- 2x S3 bucket
- 2x CloudFront distribution
- 2x Route53 records
- 1x ACM certificate (maybe 2 actually)

There are 2 of S3, CloudFront and Route53. This is to handle serving the website from the apex domain only.

1 bucket for `osgav.run` and 1 bucket for `www.osgav.run` each with their own CloudFront distribution. The `www.osgav.run` bucket is configured to redirect to the apex bucket.

### Resilience and High Availability

To the degree with which CloudFront and S3 can provide it.

### Expected traffic and load

Very little beyond constant ping of Monitis monitors.

### Tools

- `git` for version controlling (static) content, application and deployment configuration
- AWS Console for manually configuring DNS, CDN, HTTPS and hosting
- paper.li for curating (dynamic) content


## Required resources

### Required resources - storage

Minimal amounts of S3 usage.

### Required resources - metrics

Default CloudFront metrics are enabled.

## Security and access control

### "Known Issues"

- S3 origin can be accessed directly over HTTP

## System configuration

### Configuration management

Configuration is partially stored within GitHub repository (application and deployment) and the remainder is configured manually (DNS, CDN, HTTPS and hosting).

### Secrets management

AWS S3 access and secret keys are stored within TravisCI. They are referenced via variables in `.travis.yml` which TravisCI makes available to the build container.

## System backup and restore

### Backup requirements

Blog content should be backed up. It currently lives in GitHub (`osgav-blog` repository), local machine and there is a very old backup on a raspberry pi somewhere...

Manual configuration should be backed up but does not currently have a backup.

### Backup procedures

Take copy of `osgav-blog` GitHub repository and store in additional location(s).

Record / export manual configuration items.

### Restore procedures

Reconfigure manual configuration items and redeploy application...

## Monitoring and alerting

### Events and error messages

Monitis alerts in Slack `#uptime` channel

### Metrics

HTTP Response Status Codes in CloudFront / CloudWatch

### Health checks

Monitis and *is the website working?*

## Operational tasks

### Deployment

Hugo application is deployed via committing and pushing changes to `osgav-blog` GitHub repository. Push events trigger TravisCI which runs a Hugo build and publishes the output to S3.

TravisCI also runs a custom script after the build and before publishing to S3 (`post-build-script.sh`).

### Routine and sanity checks

Look at Monitis uptime monitors for osgav.run

Browse all pages and click all links on the website

### Troubleshooting

> How should troubleshooting happen? What tools are available?

_(e.g. Use a combination of the `/health` endpoint checks and the `abc-*.sh` scripts for diagnosing typical problems)_

## Maintenance tasks

### Patching

Currently several versions behind the latest for Hugo.

Working on upgrading website to the latest version, then will sort out updating Hugo regularly (as [releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) page shows it updates *quite* regularly now...)

#### Normal patch cycle

See above.

### Daylight-saving time changes

Should not affect anything. Who cares what the timestamp on blog posts is.

### Data cleardown

TODO: write script for cleaning up old versions of CSS from S3.
