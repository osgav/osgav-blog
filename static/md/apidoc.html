**Example page!**

# Biggest

This is example page of the API doc style created
[Aras Pranckevičius](https://github.com/aras-p) at Unity for Morgan McGuire's
[Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) and now part of the official Markdeep distro.
It uses content that could be an imaginary documentation page. Here would be some introduction
text.

## What is this?

**Thing** is a thing used to do stuff for various platforms. Some of the things it can do:

* Run on a computer
* Exit with an exit code
* Be a replacement for our old system, `theoldthing.exe`


## Invoking it

From the root folder, run "thing" with the target name, e.g.: `thing Yes`

### Subsection on stuff


Thing Name              | Description        |Notes
------------------------|--------------------|-----
Yes                     | Yup!               |
No                      | Nope :(            |
FileNotFound            | Doesn't find files | Pass `-sFIND_FILE=maybe` to maybe find them

#### subsubsection

lalala

#### subsubsubsection

lalala

## Markdeep syntax test

Regular styling like **bold**, _italics_, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`, the stuff.

* A
* Bullet
* List

And:

1. A
1. Numbered
1. List!

Symbol substitutions: a 45-degree turn; som x -> y arrows; some whoa ==> fancy <==> arrows.

Is this a definition list?
:   Looks like one to me
Is that right?
:   Possibly!

And a code listing:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
int main()
{
    return 1;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Markdeep diagrams:

*******************************************  Here's a text to the right of the diagram,
* +-----------------+           .-.       *  ain't that fancy. Pretty fancy indeed, I
* |\                |        .-+   |      *  must say! Markdeep diagrams are generally
* | \     A-B   *---+--> .--+       '--.  *  enclosed into a rectangle full made of `*`
* |  \              |   |     Cloud!    | *  symbols; and are "drawn" using ASCII-art
* +---+-------------+    '-------------'  *  style, with `- | + / \ * o` etc.
*******************************************  Suh-weet!


Another random diagram, just because:

<div class="admonition note">
This is a note by the way!
</div>


!!! Note
    Hey I'm a note. Don't mind me, I'm just sitting here.

!!! WARNING
    I'm a warning, perhaps. *Something might happen!*

And other admonitions:

!!! Error: Never Pass `nullptr` to a Shader
    Invoking a shader with a null argument can seg fault.
    This is a multi-line admonition.

    Seriously, don't call shaders like that.
