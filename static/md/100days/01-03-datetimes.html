# A Pomodoro in Python

```python
pomodoro_time   = timedelta(minutes=6)
shortbreak_time = timedelta(minutes=2)
longbreak_time  = timedelta(minutes=4)



def run_a_pomodoro(pd_count):
    '''
    sleep for duration of one pomodoro
    '''
    pd_start_time = datetime.today()
    print "%s --- pomodoro [%s] start time" % (pd_start_time, pd_count)
    
    time.sleep(pomodoro_time.seconds)
    
    pd_end_time = datetime.today()
    duration = pd_end_time - pd_start_time
    duration_mins = duration.seconds / 60
    print "%s --- pomodoro [%s] end time\tduration: %smins" % (pd_end_time, pd_count, duration_mins)
    
    if pd_count < 3:
        print "%s --- short break start time" % pd_end_time
        time.sleep(shortbreak_time.seconds)
        sb_end_time = datetime.today()
        duration = sb_end_time - pd_end_time
        duration_mins = duration.seconds / 60
        print "%s --- short break end time\tduration: %smins" % (sb_end_time, duration_mins)
        return pd_count
    else:
        print "%s --- long break start time" % pd_end_time
        time.sleep(longbreak_time.seconds)
        lb_end_time = datetime.today()
        duration = lb_end_time - pd_end_time
        duration_mins = duration.seconds / 60
        print "%s --- long break end time\tduration: %smins" % (lb_end_time, duration_mins)
        pd_count = 666
        return pd_count

    
pd_count = 0
while True:
    counter = run_a_pomodoro(pd_count)
    if counter == 666:
        pd_count = 0
    else:
        pd_count += 1 
```

## Next...

it would be useful to take this out of its jupyter notebook and turn into a CLI tool perhaps...

```
$ pomodoro.py -c 1 -p 2 -s 3 -l 4

    -c, --count     number of pomodoro sessions
    -p, --pomodoro  length of single pomodoro
    -s, --short     length of short break
    -l, --long      length of long break
```

and providing a summary based on numbers provided...

```
one pomodoro session:

            pomodoro + short break
            pomodoro + short break
            pomodoro + short break
            pomodoro + long break

how many pomodoro sessions would you like to run?
how long would you like a single pomodoro to be?
how long would you like a short break to be?
how long would you like a long break to be?
```

- ***by providing "pomodoro sessions" an estimated end time could be provided...***
- i.e. you want to run 3 sessions, at 15mins-2mins-5mins ?
- that'll be (3*15)+(3*2)+5 all multiplied by 3...
- so 56mins per session, making estimated end time `timedelta(minutes=168)` !
- ...
- maybe you want: 15mins-5mins-15mins, making 1 pomodoro session = 90mins
- 2 sessions is 3hrs
- 4 sessions is 6hrs
- ...
