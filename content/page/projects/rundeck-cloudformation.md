A basic CloudFormation template for spinning up an EC2 instance and installing Rundeck on it. 

This CloudFormation template simply installs Rundeck as per the instructions from their website. No further configuration is applied. You will end up with a basic Rundeck installation which you can log into with default credentials.

```
