The short answer: *no.*

Suffice to say I have spent more time playing games on my new computer than I have finishing my write-up of building it. 

At some point between post 003 and this one, I sat down and wrote rough outlines for each of the *five* remaining posts I had in mind. Some time later, I published the next one, post 004. 

Since post 004 I have changed my mind about writing the four final posts and recently wrote an even rougher outline that squashes them all into a single final post (and this isn't it).

So. 

It is not Build Day yet. 

But it will be next time...
