# Lab Notes

I've been swithering about how to use this portion of my website - I knew I wanted a *"reference"* section of some sort to accompany blog posts, and somewhere to generally experiment with my content. Until I stumbled across [this](https://ghuntley.com/notes/) I was unsure what I was really doing here - Geoff eloquently explained my scattered thoughts to me, which boil down to:

> If it’s worth writing, it’s worth keeping. The only safe bet at this stage is markdown and git.

Similarly the words on `blogumentation` over [here](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2017/06/25/blogumentation/) also resonated with me - and so in my Lab I shall maintain a collection of **notes, references, cheatsheets and links** - which I shall add to and update over time, separately and/or alongside blog posts...
