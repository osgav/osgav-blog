### 2019 Jan 24-26 Thursday-Saturday
- ... started desk/ccc/start.py (uses datetime!)

### 2019 Jan 27 Sunday

- 04-06-collections - playing with the jupyter notebook and `movies_csv`
- (add my modified ipynb to github and link here)
- ... try to use collections in 89k.py NLTKcmd ?
- ... use the Movie data from the exercise and load `plot_keywords` for each film or something?

### 2019 Feb 2 Saturday

- wrote more of desk/ccc/start.py script, nearing completion - just `draft ts` and `draft undraft` commands to go...
