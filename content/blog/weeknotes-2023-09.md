So I fell out of the habit of doing weeknotes for a few months there. 

<!--more-->

I'm going to try and start doing them regularly again, as I found they were good encouragement for doing at least a tiny bit of some form of project work each week. Like actually *doing* something, as opposed to just *making plans* to do things. 

In the last week I've started my first [Esri MOOC, specifically the Cartography one](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/596e584bb826875993ba4ebf/cartography/). It runs for the next 6 weeks. I look forward to absorbing some wisdom and practicing new things. It shall also be the first time I dabble in using ArcGIS rather than QGIS which should be interesting.
