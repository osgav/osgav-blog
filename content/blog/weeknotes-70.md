- did some catsitting for my friends who were out of town for a few days
- did some more prep for my upcoming holiday
- started figuring out how to integrate Leaflet into my Hugo website – this is in anticipation of shuffling a data collection project I've mentioned vaguely in the past along to the web map phase
- spent some time sorting my RSS subscriptions in Inoreader – they've been one long list for quite a while and I figured I'd finally make a few folders and group the ones I read more regularly into one spot on the list, so far I can't believe I didn't do this ages ago
- started reading a pop-up newsletter by [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/) about walking through Tokyo – I discovered this through [a blog post from Tracy Durnell](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/05/an-improvisational-walking-newsletter/) who I follow via RSS
