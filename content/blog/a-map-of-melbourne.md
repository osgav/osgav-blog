The *Making Maps* unit for the [Introduction to Mapping, Spatial Data and GIS](https://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/introducing-mapping-spatial-data-and-gis-online) course I completed in June featured a tourism case study. The exercise that week was to create a tourist map of Melbourne in Australia.

Given a single shapefile of point data that marked the locations of a selection of tourist attractions, we were tasked with putting them on a map. The map was to include all your fundamental map features, such as: map body, map border, graticule (coordinate grid), scale bar, north arrow, legend and acknowledgement (title, author, data sources). Oh and an inset map too.

A set of points does not a map make â€“ we were pointed to [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) and [DIVA-GIS](http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata) and told to include whatever data layers we liked. 

I spent a few hours on my map, and this is what I came up with:

[![a map of Melbourne](/images/posts/a-map-of-melbourne/melbourne_attractions.png "a map of Melbourne")](/images/posts/a-map-of-melbourne/melbourne_attractions.png)

The blurb I included with my map when I shared it in the forums was as follows: 

> I decided to try and make a map for folks who might like to take a day trip out of Melbourne while they are visiting. The Wildlife/Scenic locations being mostly outside of Melbourne inspired this. I hid the Great Ocean Road point in the bottom left as it was particularly far away, and without a more detailed road network it looked unconnected. I also added the only Cultural/Historic location outwith Melbourne, Mornington Peninsual Vineyards, as it is within a reasonable distance for day tripping I reckon. And to tempt the more adventurous (with perhaps a weekend trip in mind), I marked on the Ferry Route to Tasmania, which was in the Roads data from Natural Earth.

> Was I successful? I'm pretty pleased with my efforts. I think it's successful. If it were to encourage someone to explore the surrounding Melbourne area while they were there, then it would be truly successful.
