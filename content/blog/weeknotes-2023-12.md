A short'n'sweet update this week:

<!--more-->

- **[Observable dataviz course](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/datavizcourse):** finished up with the lectures and got stuck into [the assignment](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/data-vis-course-assignment?collection=@observablehq/data-vis-course) â€“ I'll share the notebook for that when it's finished
- **OpenStreetMap:** made my first contributions wahey! via the [StreetComplete](http://streetcomplete.app/) app
- **osgav.run Portfolio:** [spruced up](https://github.com/osgav/osgav-blog/commit/afb03d2303d499bf8bbe46448b1ec86a4f0c24a8) the [Portfolio](/portfolio.html) section of my website so it actually resembles something like a portfolio now
- **Esri Cartography MOOC:** did some more of this
