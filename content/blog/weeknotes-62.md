- attended the [Spatial Data Science Symposium](http://sdss2023.spatial-data-science.net/) (SDSS) [2023](https://www.airmeet.com/e/5b9bebf0-f574-11ed-ba17-6b737e1a0f4c) last Tuesday / Wednesday
  - it was pretty interesting, a lot of it was pretty over my head but it was inspiring nevertheless â€“ I noted a few miscellaneous things that caught my eye / things to peruse a little closer at some point:

- finished the bulk of my "trimester review" stuff
- [read](https://blog.delaplex.com/start-building-better-data-pipelines-with-apache-airflow) [about](https://michal.karzynski.pl/blog/2017/03/19/developing-workflows-with-apache-airflow/) [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) a bit, and started thinking about how I might ~~distract  myself with it~~ dabble with it in the future sometime
- celebrated a friend's birthday with a nice dinner and then staying up far too late
- began archiving starred items in my RSS reader (Inoreader)
