- created a new "notes" section on my website. i don't know exactly how i intend to use it yet, i just know i've occasionally wanted to refer to one of my obsidian notes in a blog post. but i don't want to create a separate blog post for the note to do that, and my "lab" section doesn't feel like the right place either (its kinda more for technical stuff). i guess the gist of it is i'll slowly turn some private notes into public notes.
- made some plans for a series of projects and blogged about it: [data pipeline plans](/blog/data-pipeline-plans.html)
- worked on my geolab database bootstrap scripts, per my data pipeline plans.
- played around with Model Builder in QGIS for the first time (via [30DaysOfQGIS](https://spatialthoughts.com/2024/05/13/30daysofqgis/)). i like it.
