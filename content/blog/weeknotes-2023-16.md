Things from the last couple of weeks:

<!--more-->

- worked on [GEOG 868](https://roam.libraries.psu.edu/node/1357) (I've finally gotten around to resuming work on that!)
- worked on a data collection project I've had brewing that involves Mergin Maps
- attended BCS Teatime Talks (another fascinating edition of Map Memoirs)
- played with my first Leaflet maps project a little more
- received delivery of a couple of old maps I won at auction, and relatedly...
- received delivery of some *Really Useful Boxes!* so my collection will be moving into a much better long-term storage situation, wahey :)
