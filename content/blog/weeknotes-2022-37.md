Another week passes, and what a good one it was! 
<br><br>
The highlight was definitely the [BCS Annual Conference](https://www.cartography.org.uk/annual-conference) on Wednesday and Thursday. I haven't sifted through the notes I made and links I saved yet so I'll come back to that later. 
<br><br>
Some other stuff I got up to: 

<!--more-->

- GEOG 868: played around with getting a server setup for Lesson 6 onwards, using DigitalOcean and the `doctl` [CLI](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/) â€“ so far I like what I see
- tested [CloudFront Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-cloudfront-functions-run-your-code-at-the-edge-with-low-latency-at-any-scale/) in relation to my website redesign (which is going to include a change to my URLs so I will want to set up some redirects to keep old links working)
- published [UK Freight Transport System](/blog/uk-freight-transport-system.html)
- published [critical cartographer: 1](/blog/critical-cartographer-1.html)
