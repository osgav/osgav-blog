Things I got up to in the last week:

- published blog post: [systems, processes, and tools](/blog/systems-processes-tools.html)
- read an essay on systems design: https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227 (via [this tweet](https://nitter.net/mipsytipsy/status/1633627882840035331))
- phone link dump, all the way down to zero tabs open...
- got stuck into [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) Getting Started guides and the like and...
- started playing with my own [dataset on powerplants](https://observablehq.com/d/cf412b0e164ebdd5)
- did more of the Esri [Cartography MOOC](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/596e584bb826875993ba4ebf/cartography/) (running a bit behind, need to catch up!)
- discovered, fixed an issue with, and blogged about [QGIS MapSwipe Tool Plugin](/blog/qgis-plugin-mapswipe-tool.html)
- published blog post: [Spilhaus World Ocean Map](/blog/spilhaus-world-ocean-map.html)
- started drafting up a new About page for my website (I've just had placeholder text there for a few years now...)
- started shopping for proper storage for my atlases and maps collection
- signed up for OpenStreetMap!

And some more words about a few of those...

**phone link dump:** in recent months the *capture* side of my notetaking system hasn't been operating as smoothly as it has been in the past. Basically I had let open tabs accrue in the browser on my phone instead of saving interesting things into my notes. Once again I saw the `:D` in place of a tab count in the top right... For the first time in a little while I cleared all those open tabs down to *zero* which feels about as good as tidying your desk or finishing some spring cleaning. 

**Observable:** I'm really liking what I've seen in the [Data Visualization Fundamentals and Best Practices](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/datavizcourse) course lectures so far. Observable seems like a really nifty platform for data exploration and I'm excited to get to grips with a basic set of operations to apply to a dataset of interest. I've started playing with the [Global Powerplants Datasette](https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants) which seems to be becoming my go-to test dataset these days.

**storage for my atlases and maps collection:** I've mentioned in a couple of previous weeknotes posts that I've acquired some old atlases from some auctions. I've acquired more than has been explicitly mentioned on my blog so far, enough that I could do with somewhere better to store them. I recently learned that *Really Useful Boxes* are seemingly "preservation grade" and places like museums use these for long-term storage of things that might be sensitive to the atmosphere and their environment. So that I may be a better caretaker of these old books and documents I've elected to possess, I'm planning to get some of these boxes (and those little silica gel packets for absorbing moisture). 

**OpenStreetMap:** I finally signed up for OpenStreetMap! I've had it in mind to give [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/) a go for quite a while, so hopefully I'll get around to that now that I have the pre-requisite account :)
