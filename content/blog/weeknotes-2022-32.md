So. Hello again. 

<!--more-->

Since my last weeknote (which was just over a week ago now, which was intentional so I can say the next bit) I've attended all four NASA ARSET sessions on [Urban Heat Islands and Heat Vulnerability Indices!](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/arset-satellite-remote-sensing-measuring-urban-heat-islands-and) I'm not quite finished with the course yet though. There is a little bit of homework, which I have 2 weeks to complete and submit. As such, I'll save any longer ~~rambling~~ reflecting on my NASA ARSET adventures until after that. 

Besides that, other *GIS stuff* I got up to included:

- worked through most of the rest of GEOG 868 Lesson 3 â€“ I ran my first spatial queries (wahey!) and I'm now working on the Lesson 3 Project
- started formulating something of a "study timetable" with a view to weaving in some *cartography stuff* and some *spatial analysis stuff* (more on those once I start them)
- watched video 2 of 6 from [PostGIS and OpenStreetMap](https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLHWVtzzXLMjJGYfjAjguS-Bm79KowWEI_)
- asked the folks of gischat on Twitter about [new schemas vs new databases](https://nitter.net/ZER0D0TS/status/1557454870998908932) and received a handful of insightful replies that have made their way to my notes

I've also been using [pgcli](https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli) alongside pgadmin, as I can't resist a nice CLI tool. If you use psql for stuff you might like pgcli. It has a snazzy autocomplete feature, go see the README for a preview. It's good.
