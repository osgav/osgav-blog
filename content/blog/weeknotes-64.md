Stuff from the last week:

I've been running through my ankiboxes and considering the purposes of my different IW queues and associated ankiboxes a little more closely.

I redesigned part of my homepage. The "recent feed" part now has two columns – one for blog posts and another for weeknotes. Both of these things live under the `/blog/` section of my site but I figured out a way to list them separately as well as altogether, as demonstrated by my new homepage and my new index pages: [blog.html](/blog.html) and [weeknotes.html](/weeknotes.html) and [archives.html](/archives.html)

I started a new lab page – my first since 2019 apparently – for "geolab" my [personal PostGIS server](/lab/geolab-postgis-server-manual.html). I'll be adding to this incrementally as I refine my slightly messier note I've been working on for the last few weeks. 

I managed to get caught in torrential rain twice in the last week. The second time I was slightly more prepared and had an umbrella, but honestly I didn't end up that much better off ha!
