As part of the Esri Cartography MOOC I'm doing just now, I made this Spilhaus World Ocean Map in one of the exercises. 

<!--more-->

The bathymetry layer looks somewhat like TV static because instead of choosing a more typical colour ramp (say, lighter blue to darker blue) I picked one that was a selection of greys, *that aren't even in order.* In this instance that colour ramp produced this effect, which I rather like.

With my title added I think it looks kinda like an album cover ha!
