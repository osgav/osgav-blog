Some notes on the last couple of weeks:

<!--more-->

- worked on my Mergin Maps data collection project – it's now ready for the field...
- figured out why my map in Mergin Maps was being really slow – it was some Draw Effects I put on one of the layers! so nothing to do with the level of detail in some layers, i.e. [playing around with Simplify](/blog/count-vertices-ogrinfo.html) didn't help
- published [extrapolating the edges of a bounding box](/blog/extrapolating-a-bounding-box.html) (which is the map I started recreating with Leaflet recently)
- played around with adding custom fonts to my website (not yet live though)
- attended webinar: Cambridge Seminar series on History of Cartography
  - *The Maps that Made History: Collections of Leiden University Library*
- attended webinar: University of Miami Special Collections, Conversations on Cartography
  - *Ballerinas, Butterflies, and Bucky Balls: Three Architects Redesign the World Map for the Modern Age*
- acquired a Raspberry Pi 400 woohoo!
- installed `fzf` and messed around with it a bit
