Hello from week 39 of 2022.

<!--more-->

I redesigned my website! That was a surprise. When I've had that itch before, I usually browse the [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) site and imagine what it might be like to one day be bothered enough to follow through on the concept. Then I forget about it. This time I actually selected a new theme and ran with it! And I'm pretty pleased with the result. 

My hacked up Casper theme has been retired to make way for a hacked up Congo theme, which you may have noticed via the first *"link post"* on my site that I posted yesterday. 

[A couple of weeknotes ago](/blog/weeknotes-2022-36.html) I mentioned I'd save further rambles about my redesign for once it was live, which it now is. I'm still going to hang on to those for now, as I suspect at least one is going to be its own blog post. 

As for what else I've been up to â€“ not a great deal outside of playing with my website!

In the last couple of days I've continued familiarising myself with setting up a PostGIS server on DigitalOcean. This has involved sticking `doctl` commands into bash scripts and pretending they are worthy of being referred to as *server provisioning scripts.* 

Most recently I've added [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) into the mix so that I may easily access my new servers in the cloud from my laptop and my desktop. So far I *very much* like what I see here.
