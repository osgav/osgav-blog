- weeknotes 100!
- its just shy of 2 years since i started (occasionally) writing weeknotes
- and 40 weeks since i changed my weeknotes naming convention
- as per last week i was [loading](/lab/dataset-global-powerplants.html) [some](/lab/dataset-os-addressbase.html) [datasets](/lab/dataset-supermarket-retail-points.html) into my new *geolab* database. this effort led to doing some housekeeping of my GIS folder on my filesystem. i might write about that separately later. 
- i played around with some temporal data in QGIS for the first time, making a couple of animations (per 30DaysOfQGIS)
