Look at that, it's December already! 

<!--more-->

November fairly flew by. All I was doing really (on the *GIS stuff* front) was playing around with making maps for [30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/), so I didn't bother with weeknotes updates. I had a lot of fun making maps for *20* of the days and seeing what other folks were posting. I have a blog post in the works to showcase my creations, but for now they can be found on [Twitter](https://nitter.net/ZER0D0TS) (and [Mastodon](https://vis.social/@osgav))!

I've acquired another old atlas, adding to the collection I started earlier this year. I'm looking forward to flipping through it once it arrives. I [mentioned](/blog/weeknotes-2022-29.html) I'd post more about my atlases *soon* but did nothing of the sort â€“ I have a vague notion that I'll get around to changing that, once again, *soon.* (Once I return my attention to [GEOG 868](https://roam.libraries.psu.edu/node/1357) and finish it, I'll be focusing on [GEOG 486](https://roam.libraries.psu.edu/node/1299) where I'll make some time for pouring over my old atlases.)

Relatedly to old atlases, I'm rather looking forward to the next BCS Teatime Talk next week: Mapping the contents of an atlas of Siberia, 1696. Perhaps I'll pick up some hints and tips for sharing the contents of my atlases.
