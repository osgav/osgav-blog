July was an exciting month.
<br><br>
Following my [last post](/blog/pc-build-002.html) a whole bunch of purchasing ensued. In fact, the next posts are all going to be retrospective as I've built my PC now!

What did I buy first? 

Well, first I wanted to have a look at some pre-built computers because I'd read that you can *theoretically* get a reasonable deal on a GPU this way – so long as you manage to sell (most of) the rest of the build. This quickly turned into realising I'd formed a misconception about AMD CPUs in last couple of months. I thought there was no such thing as an AMD CPU with integrated graphics. Oops!

I was aware of Intel CPUs with integrated graphics, but I had started leaning towards the idea of an AMD build, which meant I would *have to* get a GPU card. Or so I thought. 

So, armed with the knowledge that AMD CPUs with integrated graphics *do* exist, I did some searching and it didn't take long until I found myself watching another Linus Tech Tips video.

The video pointed out a specific AMD *APU* (Accelerated Processing Unit, AMD's special name for a CPU with a built-in GPU) and it pointed out a specific place one could acquire that APU. And, well... I bought it. 

But not just the CPU. As the video told me, this particular CPU only seems to be available in either pre-builts and bundles. A pre-built being the entire computer and a bundle being *most* of the internal components of a computer. I bought a bundle consisting of a motherboard, CPU, RAM and CPU cooler. Two birds with one stone! Or rather, four components with one purchase.

Sure, I was a little gutted by the idea of getting a bundle and having a little less computer building to do myself, but after a week of deliberating over whether or not to get the bundle, I was over that. One thing that helped sway me was: of the two motherboard choices, one had caught my eye before. So I was still able to get the motherboard I was hoping to (ASUS TUF range) with this bundle.

Also I was able to get an awesome looking passive CPU cooler that I discovered via the same site, earlier in my deliberations while I was browsing their other products. 

All in all I was really happy when my bundle arrived – and thoroughly entertained to see how massive the CPU cooler was!

*So, the details I've omitted from above are...*

- the Linus Tech Tips video is:
  - ***[You CAN'T buy AMD's best product… - Ryzen 7 4750G APU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asz4v4bH8bE)***
- Quiet PC is where I purchased my bundle, specifically this one:
  - ***[AMD CPU and micro-ATX Motherboard Bundle](https://www.quietpc.com/sys-bundle-ryzen-uatx)***
- and it was configured with...
  - `ASUS TUF B550M-PLUS GAMING (WI-FI) AM4 Micro-ATX Motherboard`
  - `AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 4750G 3.6GHz 8C/16T 65W AM4 APU`
  - `Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 3200MHz Memory`
  - `Nofan CR-80EH Copper IcePipe 80W Fanless CPU Cooler`
