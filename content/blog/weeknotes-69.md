It's one of those weeks where I didn't get  up to much that I feel like rambling about.

But I did redesign the footer of my website. And I'm pretty pleased with how that turned out. I'm enjoying learning more about layouts in CSS using flex (and implementing them with Tailwind).

I'm as pleased with this as I am the site header redesign that I mentioned a couple of weeks ago. I realise I said I was ridiculously excited about that and then I haven't said anything about it since publishing it, but that's only because it'll be a blog post rather than a weeknotes, and well, I'm good at procrastinating those.
