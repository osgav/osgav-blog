What did the 61st week since I wrote my first weeknotes post bring...

<!--more-->

- read [The Mystery of Bloomfield Bridge](https://tylervigen.com/the-mystery-of-the-bloomfield-bridge) – a thoroughly investigated and well told story about an innocuous footbridge, I highly recommend it
- did some personal "trimester review" stuff aka looking back and reflecting and looking ahead and planning and such
- made a few tweaks to `osgav.run` CSS (links, code formatting, some headings)
- installed the [Obsidian Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) plugin to better manage my notes around *"stuff I want to do"* with `osgav.run` and got all my existing notes migrated into a new kanban board, so far so good...
- got distracted part way through that and started playing with one of my ideas (about "collections" and being able to group certain blog posts together, like weeknotes for example)
- a very beautiful old atlas I won at auction arrived :D I've been meaning to post about the atlases I've won at auction on here but haven't got around to it yet, whenever I do I look forward to sharing this belter
- went on the third field trip for a new data collection project I recently started, that makes use of Mergin Maps for the data collection bit – more to come on this project soon™
