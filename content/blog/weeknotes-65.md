For the last couple of weeks I've been meaning to revisit a link I saved a long time ago, about different formats of weeknotes. 

That link was: https://weeknot.es/weeknote-styles-61d957e58a4a

Ok I've re-read it now. The phrase *stream of consciousness* jumped out at me. I am familiar with this phrase as it's something I spend plenty of time doing in my notes in Obsidian. And I feel like doing some stream of consciousness rambling instead of bullet points this week. Actually... it appears it's been a few weeks since I've done just bullet points so I guess that isn't new. In fact I will do some bullets. Here:

- I had a look at an old project that I haven't yet shared on here but did mention [back in May](/blog/weeknotes-2023-18.html) – my first time dabbling with Leaflet, recreating what I made in ["extrapolating the edges of a bounding box"](/blog/extrapolating-a-bounding-box.html) – as I want to finish it up, i.e. post it on here then try some more stuff with Leaflet
- I did a little bit of work on my geolab PostGIS database (but not anything that merited a further update to the new lab page I created recently)
- went on another field trip for the data collection project I mentioned a few weeks ago
- visited a friend and watched the entirety of season 16 of Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia
- started reading [Networks of New York](http://lifewinning.com/projects/networks-of-new-york/) which is a really cool project by [Ingrid Burrington](http://lifewinning.com/) (if you like reading and thinking about internet infrastructure)
- did some admin stuff for an upcoming holiday
