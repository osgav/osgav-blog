**ankibox?**

*anki + inbox = ankibox*

<!--more-->

**what is it?**

a component of [my ever changing notetaking system](/blog/my-everchanging-notetaking-system.html): a script that puts notes in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) INBOX folder into an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck

or more generally, it takes a *source of notes* and synchronizes them with an Anki deck. it began life only able to sync a single folder of notes to a single Anki deck, but I've since extended it to support multiple sources, both folder-based and file-based, each syncing to their own deck.

**why?**

the main driving reason behind this concept is to make it easier to revisit, review, and revise existing notes.

different ankiboxes have different purposes, but they are all in service of resurfacing existing notes of some sort.
