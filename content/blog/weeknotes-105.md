- flat viewings will continue until moral improves.
- i started playing around with a [new side project](https://devrant.com/rants/1864706/unfinished-projects) â€“ a friend was in town and they have plans to visit all the bookshops, take photos of them, and make a collage. so naturally i found an excuse to introduce a map element, and started a new web map. we didn't get a chance to try it out properly though. next time!
