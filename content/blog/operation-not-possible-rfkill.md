Are you googling for `rfkill` :question:

It is probably either a hardware switch or BIOS setting that has disabled your wireless...

**Possibility 1:**

> you have a physical switch or button (or Function key + something) for toggling wireless on and off - is wireless enabled here?
>
> you might also have an LED indicator for this toggle

**Possibility 2:**

> you have a BIOS setting for toggling wireless on and off - is wireless enabled here?
>
> you'll have to reboot to check this one

**Possibility 3:**

> something else...
