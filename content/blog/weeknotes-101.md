- finished up 30DaysOfQGIS! it was a lot of fun. 10/10 recommend for people interested in QGIS. i'm now plotting projects where i can play around with the Model Designer some more.
- made some progress on a RPi-based homelab project i've had on the backburner for ages, by way of acquiring an RPi4 and beginning to prepare the space in which it will live
- played around with scrapy a little bit
- collected my recent geolab-related pages into a [portfolio page](/portfolio/postgis-geodatabase.html)
