- the academic season is kicking off and consequently there have been a few notifications of lecture series landing in my inbox. i have signed up for a few. i rather enjoy listening to folks talking about old maps and the history of cartography and such
- went to a gig to see a band i haven't listened to much since i was a teenager, that was a fun trip down memory lane
- i started playing around with redesigning the header on my website â€“ i am ridiculously excited about one particular aspect of it but i am going to keep that a secret for now (yes, of course it's map-related)
