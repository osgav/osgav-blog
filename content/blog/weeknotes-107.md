- the flat hunt is complete! woohoo! next stop, moving day
- so very glad the flat viewings will cease. there were fun days, but also tiring days. i'm really happy with the flat my brother will be moving into, it will suit him down to the ground
- saw Death From Above 1979 in Glasgow last week and it was damn good – the 20 year anniversary of [You're a Woman, I'm a Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_a_Woman,_I%27m_a_Machine) so they just played the album start to finish, and then some new tunes i'm less familiar with afterwards
- had some dinner at Buck's Bar before the gig and was defeated, in the sense i had to use a knife and fork to consume the burger, i felt shame, very tasty though
- started the [PyQGISChallenge](https://spatialthoughts.com/2024/07/15/pyqgis-challenge/) from Spatial Thoughts – the same idea as 30DaysOfQGIS in May, but this time going through the [PyQGIS course materials](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/pyqgis-masterclass.html)
