The first *Student Reflection* in [GEOG 486 Lesson 1](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/643) asks:

***Which map of the two below best communicates the trend of the data? Why?***

**My answer:**

The right-hand map with the different hues of purple does a better job of communicating the trend of the data. 

This is because there is an obvious relation between the changing colours and a changing scale of numbers. Light to dark, low to high. Perhaps it could be high to low, the direction isn't necessarily a given (if there was no legend to indicate), but dark tends to mean *more*. Like more ink on the page to represent more occurrences / instances leads to a darker colour. 

The left-hand map has a random selection of colours, and there is nothing intuitive about whether green should represent a higher or lower number than purple or orange.
