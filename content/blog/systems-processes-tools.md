**What are systems, processes, and tools?**

<!--more-->

**Systems** are a collection of things interacting. Things such as people and computers, manual and automated processes, physical tools and software tools.

**Processes** are sequences of actions or operations that might be performed by a person or computer, either a manually operated computer (the combination of a person and computer performing the action within the process) or an automated computer.

**Tools** are either physical things a person uses to perform some action (like a hammer) or tools are computer software[^1] used to achieve operations within processes that involve computers (either operated manually by a person or automatically by the computer). 

[^1]: In the world of software development and systems engineering, "tool" might only refer to particular types of computer software. It depends on who you are talking to. Other common terms include application, app, webapp, service, program, procedure, function, and indeed *system.* Things that are operated and interacted with via command-line environments are often referred to as CLI tools.

### what is this? 

This is the contents of a note I started writing to develop my understanding of the definitions of these concepts. I've shared this as a blog post today but I'll create a lab note for it in the future where I will iterate on it. I will probably remember to come back here and add a link to that when I create it...
