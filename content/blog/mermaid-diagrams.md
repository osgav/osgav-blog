### Grafana

I have Grafana to thank for introducing me to Mermaid diagrams - one day at work a new *Diagram* widget appeared and naturally I had to explore further.

[What I found amazed me](https://grafana.com/plugins/jdbranham-diagram-panel). If you are a fan of diagramming, markdown, and CLI tools - and have not heard of [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/), you are in for a treat!

*:heart:*

### Flowcharts

Mostly I find myself making use of the basic flowchart abilities. You can quickly conjure up `something` like this in a couple of minutes:

{{< mermaid/diagram >}}

graph LR;

A(something 1)
B(something 2)
C(something 3)
D(something 4)
E(something 5)
F(something 6)
G(something 7)
H(something 9)
I(something 10)

A-->B
A-->C
A-->D
B-->E
C-->E
C-->F
C-->G
D-->G
F-->H
F-->I


{{< / mermaid/diagram >}}

<br />

By writing the following:

```
graph LR;

A(something 1)
B(something 2)
C(something 3)
D(something 4)
E(something 5)
F(something 6)
G(something 7)
H(something 9)
I(something 10)

A-->B
A-->C
A-->D
B-->E
C-->E
C-->F
C-->G
D-->G
F-->H
F-->I
```

Of course you can use slightly more meaningful names, rather than A, B, C etc. You can also define the names as you go, though I've started to prefer listing them all out first - it makes future adjustments easier.


{{< mermaid/diagram >}}

graph LR;

LB(Loadbalancer)-->AppLogin(Login Service)
LB-->AppWeb(Web Service)
LB-->AppData(Data Service)
AppLogin-->DBUser(User Database)
AppWeb-->DBUser
AppData-->DBUser

{{< / mermaid/diagram >}}

```
graph LR;

LB(Loadbalancer)-->AppLogin(Login Service)
LB-->AppWeb(Web Service)
LB-->AppData(Data Service)
AppLogin-->DBUser(User Database)
AppWeb-->DBUser
AppData-->DBUser
```

You don't actually need to provide (Different Names) like that either, if you don't care about spaces, so this could be cleaner:

```
graph LR;

Loadbalancer --> LoginService
Loadbalancer --> WebService
Loadbalancer --> DataService

LoginService --> UserDatabase
WebService --> UserDatabase
DataService --> UserDatabase
```

Flowcharts can also include **subgraphs** which become very helpful when making larger diagrams. For example, see how the `something` flowchart above changes when subgraphs are introduced:



{{< mermaid/diagram >}}
graph LR;

A(something 1)
B(something 2)
D(something 4)
E(something 5)
G(something 7)

subgraph tada;
  C(something 3)
  F(something 6)
  H(something 9)
  I(something 10)
end

A-->B
A-->C
A-->D
B-->E
C-->E
C-->F
C-->G
D-->G
F-->H
F-->I
{{< / mermaid/diagram >}}

{{< mermaid/diagram >}}
graph LR;

subgraph tada;
  A(something 1)
  C(something 3)
  F(something 6)
end

B(something 2)
D(something 4)
E(something 5)
G(something 7)
H(something 9)
I(something 10)

A-->B
A-->C
A-->D
B-->E
C-->E
C-->F
C-->G
D-->G
F-->H
F-->I
{{< / mermaid/diagram >}}


{{< mermaid/diagram >}}
graph LR;

subgraph tada;
  A(something 1)
  B(something 2)
  E(something 5)
  I(something 10)
end

subgraph tada;
  G(something 7)
  H(something 9)
end

C(something 3)
D(something 4)
F(something 6)


A-->B
A-->C
A-->D
B-->E
C-->E
C-->F
C-->G
D-->G
F-->H
F-->I
{{< / mermaid/diagram >}}

```

```

Oh and you can nest subgraphs too! And change the flow direction:

{{< mermaid/diagram >}}
graph TB;

subgraph tada;
  A(something 1)
  B(something 2)
  subgraph fiveten;
    E(something 5)
    I(something 10)
  end
end

subgraph tada;
  G(something 7)
  H(something 9)
end

C(something 3)
D(something 4)
F(something 6)


A-->B
A-->C
A-->D
B-->E
C-->E
C-->F
C-->G
D-->G
F-->H
F-->I
{{< / mermaid/diagram >}}

<br />

Depending on your groupings/subgraphs and interactions you might end up with something a bit less messy than that last example. You may also find that moving definitions in and out of subgraphs can really shuffle things around, for what seemed like a subtle change. Here is a reasonably sized, subgraph-filled diagram I've created at work:

{{< mermaid/diagram >}}

Still pretty messy towards the *Cloud Origins*, but pretty useful overall for conveying main traffic flows when explaining how parts of the website were served during our migration from *The Datacenters* to *The Cloud...*

It's even possible for the nodes in a flowchart to be hyperlinks - so they can link off to other useful resources like monitoring or documentation!

Achieved with definitions such as:

```
click EMEA "https://monitoring.example.com" "view EMEA realtime monitoring"
```

Bonus points for you if you noticed this already in the *Mermaid Diagrams Are Awesome* flowchart at the start of this post.


### Sequence Diagrams


Here is a sequence diagram example covering a slice of my day job:

{{< mermaid/diagram >}}

sequenceDiagram;
    participant VendorAPI
    participant MetricsCollector
    participant MonitoringSystem
    participant osgav
    participant AlertingSystem

    Note over VendorAPI,MonitoringSystem: data collection
    loop 45 seconds
      MetricsCollector->>VendorAPI: give me last 5mins data
      MetricsCollector->>MonitoringSystem: send metrics
    end

    Note over MonitoringSystem,AlertingSystem: anomaly detection
    loop 1 minute
      AlertingSystem->>MonitoringSystem: give me last 10mins data
      MonitoringSystem->>AlertingSystem: here you go
      opt rule match
        AlertingSystem-->>osgav: anomaly detected!
      end
    end

    Note over VendorAPI,MonitoringSystem: data integrity
    loop 15 minutes
      MetricsCollector->>MonitoringSystem: give me last 2hrs data
      opt dataset incomplete
        MetricsCollector-->>VendorAPI: query for missing data
        MetricsCollector-->>MonitoringSystem: backfill missing metrics
      end
    end

    Note over MonitoringSystem,AlertingSystem: "monitoring"
    loop adhocly
      osgav->>MonitoringSystem: show me the data
      MonitoringSystem->>osgav: here you go
      opt 
        osgav-->>AlertingSystem: forge rule updates
      end
    end

{{< / mermaid/diagram >}}

<br />

We write some code (*MetricsCollector*) that frequently pings an API (*VendorAPI*) to retrieve *real-time monitoring data* which we then shovel into an internal API (*MonitoringSystem*) which allows us to use all our favourite internal tools to query, visualize and alert on it (*MonitoringSystem again for brevity, AlertingSystem*).

I started off thinking the above would seem like a weird abuse of sequence diagrams to those who use them regularly, but a little reading up on them led me to find the following, which I guess explains why it felt like a good weird as I wrote it:

> "While there is the assumption that Sequence Diagrams were made for developers, the truth is that a companyâ€™s business staff could use such diagrams to communicate how exactly the business presently currently works by illustrating how the different business objects interact." - [Creately](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/the-basics-the-purpose-of-sequence-diagrams-part-1/)

> Some more notes from Creately: [here](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/sequence-diagram-tutorial/) and [here](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/10-common-mistakes-to-avoid-in-sequence-diagrams/)


The syntax for my diagram is as follows:

```
sequenceDiagram;
    participant VendorAPI
    participant MetricsCollector
    participant MonitoringSystem
    participant osgav
    participant AlertingSystem

    Note over VendorAPI,MonitoringSystem: data collection
    loop 45 seconds
      MetricsCollector->>VendorAPI: give me last 5mins data
      MetricsCollector->>MonitoringSystem: send metrics
    end

    Note over MonitoringSystem,AlertingSystem: anomaly detection
    loop 1 minute
      AlertingSystem->>MonitoringSystem: give me last 10mins data
      MonitoringSystem->>AlertingSystem: here you go
      opt rule match
        AlertingSystem-->>osgav: anomaly detected!
      end
    end

    Note over VendorAPI,MonitoringSystem: data integrity
    loop 15 minutes
      MetricsCollector->>MonitoringSystem: give me last 2hrs data
      opt dataset incomplete
        MetricsCollector-->>VendorAPI: query for missing data
        MetricsCollector-->>MonitoringSystem: backfill missing metrics
      end
    end

    Note over MonitoringSystem,AlertingSystem: "monitoring"
    loop adhocly
      osgav->>MonitoringSystem: show me the data
      MonitoringSystem->>osgav: here you go
      opt 
        osgav-->>AlertingSystem: forge rule updates
      end
    end
```
### Gantt Charts

Mermaid can also render Gantt charts, but they definitely look like the least enjoyable to write. So far I haven't convinced myself to try. See details [here](https://mermaidjs.github.io/gantt.html).

### Mermaid CLI

It just gets better: there is even a [CLI tool](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli)!

> This CLI tool takes a mermaid definition file as input and generates svg/png/pdf file as output.

**Examples**

```
mmdc -i input.mmd -o output.svg -w 1024 -H 768
mmdc -i input.mmd -o output.png
mmdc -i input.mmd -o output.png -b '#FFF000'
mmdc -i input.mmd -o output.png -b transparent
mmdc -i input.mmd -o output.png -t forest
```

All sorts of possibilities exist due to there being a CLI tool here... for example you could create a more rudimentary version of the Grafana-Mermaid integration.

Instead of elements of a flowchart being tied to a timeseries metric, a script could determine adjustments to the mermaid code (*change a solid line to a dashed line or colour a node orange instead of green to represent link degradation for example*) and regenerate an `output.png` based on this change. 

That image could be placed in some `/var/www/public/` folder and is available to relevant people via `https://internal.example.com/network/status.png` or... you could load that image in a Grafana text panel of course!
