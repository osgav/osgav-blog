I've been thinking about the capture workflow of my notetaking system a lot in the last week, and working on refining it, so that I can use it more effectively... as the concept of [Collectorâ€™s Fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/) has felt particularly resonant lately.

I finished archiving all my Inoreader RSS starred items, so I have a clean slate / zero starred items in Inoreader now. This should theoretically / hopefully lead to more effective processing of newly starred items from my browsing... I use [this Inoreader CLI](https://github.com/Linusp/python-inoreader) (with a few modifications) to save my starred items from Inoreader into my INBOX folder in Obsidian. Once I've downloaded the recently starred items, I can make notes with them and reference them and whatever else, and then unstar them in Inoreader, paving the way for the next batch. That's the theory at least!

Once something is in my INBOX folder, it is also in my [ankibox](/blog/ankibox.html). I've started experimenting with additional ankiboxes too now (based on items I've been adding to different [IW queues](https://github.com/bjsi/incremental-writing) for a while). I expect I'll write more about this in the future, but so far ankibox has led to navel gazing about ankibox. But it feels like useful pondering at this point in time, as I try to figure out where the whole ankibox concept best fits within my capture workflow or *"knowledge cycle"...*
