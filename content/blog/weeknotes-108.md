- thoroughly enjoyed the lack of flat viewings this week
- also continuing to enjoy the [PyQGISChallenge](https://spatialthoughts.com/2024/07/15/pyqgis-challenge/)
- upgraded Fedora Linux on my laptop (finally! i've been *slightly* out of date for *slightly* too long)
- working through the OS upgrade aftermath, things are very nearly all operational again
- visited the zoo for the first time in i don't know how many years, was a jolly good afternoon. the trip was pretty much on a whim after discovering there were a bunch of LEGOÂ® models there for only a few more days. had fun guessing the brick counts as we approached them. my guesses were mostly terrible.
