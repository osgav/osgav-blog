Some stuff I got up to in the last week:

<!--more-->

- attended second session of [NASA ARSET air quality course](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/arset-accessing-and-analyzing-air-quality-data-geostationary)
- attended [BCS Teatime Talk](https://www.cartography.org.uk/teatime-talks) about The Cameron Aquatic Projection
- noted down and played with a couple more 30DayMapChallenge ideas
- played with the QuickOSM QGIS plugin and made a little map of a Google Street View car sighting from my walk the day before
- acquired another old map from an auction â€“ like with those old atlases I acquired, I'm sure I'll get around to sharing some photos (or even proper scans) of it eventually!
