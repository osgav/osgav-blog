> "Everything starts from a dot." 

<!--more-->

I came across this quote via Leuchtturm1917 – the folks who makes notebooks that are very popular with folks who like to bullet journal. I started bullet journaling last year and after a few months of enjoying it with a plain paper notebook I decided to get myself the coveted *dotted paper notebook* from Leuchtturm1917. It so happened there was a [special Bauhaus Edition of the notebook available](https://www.leuchtturm1917.co.uk/notebooks/special-editions/bauhaus-edition/) at the time and it caught my eye so I got one, along with a regular one. 

The inside cover of the Bauhaus Edition reads:

> Vasily Kandinksy, Russian-born artist and former Bauhaus deputy director, had a point when he said, **&raquo;Everything starts from a dot&laquo;.** The dot is the point of departure for every line, whether it develops into a sketch, structure or script. Kandinsky elaborated on this in his 1926 book *&raquo;Point and Line to Plane&laquo;.* Your passion may be art, architecture or autobiography – but the future begins here...

The quote came to mind when I revisited a recent note, where I had saved another quote about dots:

> "The dots connect later."

I found this one exploring [Alexander Obenauer](https://alexanderobenauer.com/)'s website. While talking about [ideas](https://alexanderobenauer.com/thinking/ideas/) and [dots](https://alexanderobenauer.com/thinking/dots/) Alexander compressed a longer quote from Steve Jobs (that mentions dots, of course) into something beautifully succinct that has stuck with me since I first read it.

I like the idea of looking back and reflecting on how you've arrived at where you are, and considering points along the way as dots that form a bigger picture when connected. 

When I first saved Alexander's quote, I was reminded of *another* quote about dots I had saved before. 

> "Read to collect the dots, write to connect them." 

This one is from [David Perell](https://perell.com/) and was accompanied by an illustration which made it pretty memorable too.

# endless experiments

So... what about my notetaking system then? My *ever changing* notetaking system?

When I started looking into notetaking more seriously in 2020, I wrote a blog post declaring I was starting an [experiment](/blog/para-zettelkasten-experiment.html). Over the next 6 months I wrote a few more blog posts on the topic. When I looked back, they weren't quite what I had aspired to write at the beginning. 

In my [experiment conclusion](/blog/para-zettelkasten-conclusion.html) I listed a few items that, at different points, I had very much been meaning to write about. But for each of those items (and others) it didn't take me long until I was thinking about and tinkering with the next idea. I could have written *many* "My *XYZ* Experiment" blog posts, but instead I wrote none.

Fast forward to now and, well, that hasn't changed much to be honest. The rate at which I dive into rabbit holes might have slowed down a bit, but I do still have at least a handful of experimental things within my notetaking system that I could (and would like to) write about. 

Every now and then I think something like *"I could write a little bit about this"* but then its followed by *"ah but I'll need to introduce the whole thing with some backstory and context and so on..."* and I quickly lose enthusiasm. I'm no longer imagining writing a *little bit,* I'm imagining a laborious endeavour. One where I must cover everything in detail up to the point I'm at now – just so I can add the little bit at the end. Just so I can add a single dot at the end...

I need to *start* from a dot.

A bunch of dots, in fact.

Only dots though. Not thoroughly detailed accounts of how each of those dots came to be – I can do that later, or maybe never – just an initial dot for a few of the things I've contemplated writing about before now.

This post shall be that first dot for all the experimental things I've listed below.

# a cluster of dots

### system diary
- trying to keep *most* thoughts and notes related to my notetaking system in one place

### Command Panel note
- I'm building a toolbox panel in my sidebar
  - Buttons, Templater, Text Expand
  - Buttons, Incremental Writing
  - Dice Roller and my "zettel questions" template

### Home note and Horizons note
- keeping the number of notes I leave open to a minimum
- keeping plans I make visible

### the Incremental Writing plugin
- a "writing inbox" that works for me

### spaced repetition and Anki
- the Obsidian_to_Anki plugin
- an idea I'm calling "ankibox"

### migrating to nested tags
- "system tags" vs "topic tags"

### weekly and monthly review templates
- Looking Back and Looking Ahead

### daily notes
- my RandomNote prompt
- using QuickAdd for fleeting notes

# dot dot dot...

That's all for now. 

See you at the next dot!
