Just a few things to note this week:

<!--more-->

- I finished the Lesson 4 Project for GEOG 868: [Jen and Barry's Site Selection](/blog/jen-barry-site-selection.html)
- I started working on Lesson 5 â€“ it turns out I can in fact *open* an Esri geodatabase in QGIS, I just can't edit and save it, but I can export it into a new project where I can, and then try and figure out the QGIS equivalents to the ArcGIS terminology
- I had a quick look at what lays ahead in Lesson 6
- my [British Cartographic Society](https://www.cartography.org.uk/) membership welcome pack arrived and I started reading the cartography book it included
- watched video 3 of 6 from [PostGIS and OpenStreetMap](https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLHWVtzzXLMjJGYfjAjguS-Bm79KowWEI_)
