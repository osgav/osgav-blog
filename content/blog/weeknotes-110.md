- my brother's flat hunt is thoroughly complete now as i helped him move into his new place last week! he was indeed pleased with it, which pleased me, and the rest of the family too. crisis averted, phew!
- i finished the [PyQGISChallenge](https://spatialthoughts.com/2024/07/15/pyqgis-challenge/)! mostly! i'm about half way through putting together a toy plugin as the mini project for the last couple of days. i'll post about that specifically once its done.
- and i sorted the last bit of OS upgrade aftermath, which was sorting out my geolab database again. this involved an excursion into the land of containers, which i haven't visited for a while, to extract my postgres 13 database for loading into my new postgres 15 database. now everything is pretty much as it was a few weeks ago. jolly good!
