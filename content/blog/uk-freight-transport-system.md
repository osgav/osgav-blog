For the graded assignment in the [Introduction to Mapping, Spatial Data and GIS](https://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/introducing-mapping-spatial-data-and-gis-online) course I completed in June I made the following map:

[![UK Freight Transport System - shipping ports without rail connections](/images/posts/uk-freight-transport-system/map_35.png "UK Freight Transport System - shipping ports without rail connections")](/images/posts/uk-freight-transport-system/map_65.png)

<!--more-->

The (naïve) idea behind my map was to mix together the vague and broad terms "supply chain analysis" and "climate change" which led me to the thought: what would be the best shipping port to connect to the rail network next?

The consideration of shipping port busyness covering the "supply chain analysis" angle, and rail freight being a greener form of transport than road haulage covering the "climate change" angle.

My objective was to make a map that demonstrates the skills I learned throughout the course – and my map did that. I can say with a large degree of *certainty* that this map does not point out the next best shipping ports to connect to the railway network (unless I stumbled across a reasonable conclusion by accident) due to my knowledge of the amount of *uncertainty* that went into its creation. 

Today I'm just sharing the end result, and I will work backwards from there, sharing more about the elements of uncertainty I encountered in separate posts.
