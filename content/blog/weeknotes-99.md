- finished up my geolab database bootstrap scripts
- started loading some datasets into geolab
- did some more 30DaysOfQGIS
- started reading https://brr.fyi per a recommendation from a friend – a blog from someone deployed to Antarctica to do IT stuff. the blogger has "always been a fan of remote infrastructure, logistics, and energy systems" so rather than a steady supply of penguin photos the About page informs me i'm more likely to get a steady supply of "tedious posts about infrastructure" – sounds good to me!
- decided to investigate [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) in relation to the web scraper i mentioned in [data pipeline plans](/blog/data-pipeline-plans.html)
