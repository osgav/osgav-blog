- added my phone to my Tailscale network so i can test web maps on mobile more effectively â€“ this was spurred by noticing `100vh` as a height unit in my CSS didn't behave as expected on mobile vs *Responsive Design Mode* in my web browser (it turns out `100dvh` is what i was after)
- did a little more work on my new [Edinburgh Bookshops](/files/gis/edinburgh-bookshops/mobile.html) web map and uploaded it to osgav.run (that link might break in the future... if it has you can probably find the map via my [portfolio](/portfolio.html))
- started tinkering with customizing the protomaps basemap
- continued helping my brother with his flat hunt
