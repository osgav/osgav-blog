I did a thing the other day and the result wasn't quite what I was aiming for. But it was reasonably close and looked nice anyway. I shared it on [Mastodon](https://vis.social/@osgav/112023818125101891) and in the replies I was introduced to [The Glitch Gallery](https://glitchgallery.org/). Now the thing I did is [published](https://glitchgallery.org/neon-giraffe/) in The Glitch Gallery. Wahey!

[![a black canvas with a network of squiggly red lines drawn over it. the red lines have a glowing effect like neon lights. the glowing effect is more intense for some parts of some of the lines. there is a central nucleus of glowyness within the network. there is also a bunch of straight red lines that are less prominent that shouldn't be there. oops.](/images/posts/neon-giraffe/neon_giraffe.png)](/images/posts/neon-giraffe/neon_giraffe.png)

> While attempting to plot some lines representing the routes of buses in Edinburgh using some point-based [data](https://tfe-opendata.readme.io/docs/services), I didnâ€™t account for multiple bus routes having the same destination. This earned me some unexpected straight lines in addition to the squiggly lines I was aiming for. The glowing neon style is courtesy of QGIS with some minor tweaks.
